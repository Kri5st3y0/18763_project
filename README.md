### üßê Discssion: *Why is PostgreSQL DB table better compared to a NoSQL Database?*
**Schema Enforcement**  
PostgreSQL enforces a defined schema that enhances data integrity by specifying the structure of the data, including data types and constraints. Even in cases where certain columns may be missing in files like `female_players_20.csv`, this schema framework effectively prevents the entry of invalid data and ensures consistency across records. This mechanism effectively prevents the entry of invalid data (For example, input of `String` value into `IntegerType` column is invalid) and ensures consistency across records.  
  
**Complex SQL Queries**  
Structured data enables the execution of complex `SQL` queries like `JOIN` facilitating sophisticated data analysis and retrieval. Such operations may be cumbersome or less efficient in NoSQL databases, which are typically optimized for simpler queries and less rigid data structures.
